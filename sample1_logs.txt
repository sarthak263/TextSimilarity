8/28/2023 2:29:46 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => OK. So as you guys know, Isco is too small. Well, the building is too small for our group. So we're moving to a new building. It's going to be the building across the street and we're actually moving in three weeks. But the problem is that the administration wants to know who's going to be in what office in the new building and where we'll get, we're going to put things like. The printer, the fax machine, all the big equipment and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment. And they want to know where we're going to do all of this by November 2nd. So that means basically next Tuesday, and since we don't really have any other time, we have to make. These decisions today. What we're getting is 9 rooms for a maximum of 18 people, which is OK because there's only fifteen of us and all the rooms have windows, luckily, so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't. There's two views, either of the Old Town or the mountains, and the rooms have various sizes. There's 2-3 people rooms 5 two person rooms which are on the corners of the building, so you actually get. Windows on two walls. And two, one person rooms. That's pretty much what the building looks like. And then you have the number of people per room. The courtyard. Because we're on the 6th floor, you can't actually go out to it, but just means that the windows look out onto open space. And you can see the bathrooms, the elevators are sort of further down the hall. The purple bar at the bottom sort of on the right is the mailboxes. All of the windows open. You can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building. And the equipment that we have to put somewhere are, like I said, the photocopier, which is really big, the fax machine, which is not so big, and the printer, which is relatively big. Each office has a white board, a bulletin board and a coat rack, no cupboards like we have in the current offices. And each person gets their own chair, their own corner desk. So like the the ones that we have now, a small filing cabinet with three drawers. And by small, I mean they're about that tall. And one sort of hanging shelf, so we don't get the bookcases like we have now, but just one shelf that's attached to the wall. And the people that we have to place. You can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on. And I guess the question, the first question is how we want to organize people, whether we want to do it by rank or by project or? I don't know, put all the PhD students together, all the professors together and that sort of thing. So the idea is that we come up with a plan, there's another group who's gonna be working on the same plan later this week, and then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the 2nd. So I have to come up with a plan, possibly if we have time and presentation, a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best. OK. So anyone have any ideas or? I guess.
8/28/2023 2:29:55 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => And do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the whole? In terms of security staff, if we can, I mean my idea is to put the photocopy on the facts. In the hole, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:30:01 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => I think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building. So as long as the things are physically attached to the wall so they can't be removed, then it should be OK to leave them in the hall. It's just a question of whether you're printing the sensitive documents or whatever.
8/28/2023 2:30:05 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So we only get one printer for 15 people.
8/28/2023 2:30:37 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer, which Isella has one, maybe, Yeah, I can't remember who else. Yeah, But no one else gets their own printer. In terms of equipment. It's sort of the same thing as we have now. So what I'd propose is that we sort of discussed various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Ohh. And on the map the little half circular well quarter circles are doors, which I'm assuming you figured out, but just in case. And there's just the one room that actually has 2 doors going into it, the the three person room on the right.
8/28/2023 2:30:37 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Yeah, and do we need a room like a reading?
8/28/2023 2:30:56 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Room, Yes, Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room. That's a good idea, so we should leave a space for that. And we can't because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and there's only fifteen of us. And I don't know if you noticed, but two of us are only here half the time, so Martin and David are half the time at the PFL and half the time in Geneva, so. Sort of. Keep that in mind, I guess. When. You're doing the actual planning.
8/28/2023 2:30:59 PM: Speaker Unknown => Hmm.
8/28/2023 2:30:59 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => The first split we can do is between administration and research.
8/28/2023 2:31:00 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, I mean.
8/28/2023 2:31:04 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => It's completely different work so. We can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then.
8/28/2023 2:31:08 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah. But Giselle is really the only.
8/28/2023 2:31:20 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Administrators deal with that. Yeah. Particular situation, yeah. And then see. With the other because they were thinking at Gisela is quite, I mean Gillette Giselle's work is quite noisy because it's secretary. So you get yeah lots of phone call. And stuff like that. And she's. Always moving around so you won't share an office with gisella unless you have 50% and not the 50% is working, yeah, which is another condition.
8/28/2023 2:31:30 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Which I don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them.
8/28/2023 2:31:31 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So, I don't know, maybe we can decide that Jesus likes having one of the one person room. Yeah, I I would suggest that too. Yeah, maybe convenient.
8/28/2023 2:31:42 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, either that or maybe put her in a two person room. With the equipment? Or like with the the photocopier? Or maybe not the photocopier but the printer.
8/28/2023 2:31:42 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Yeah. But at least the thing we know is that Jessica is going to be alone. Yeah. Yeah. Or with equipment.
8/28/2023 2:31:47 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => But not with 100% staff and staff worker.
8/28/2023 2:31:52 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => OK, so it's a one person room, but we don't know how how big they are or it's hard to tell. I mean, Gisella has this funny, uh, typing.
8/28/2023 2:31:53 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, the rooms aren't tiny if you.
8/28/2023 2:31:55 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Look at the facts. Yeah, so probably she should Get the facts right.
8/28/2023 2:32:07 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, yeah, that makes sense to put the facts in there. So.
8/28/2023 2:32:15 PM: Speaker Unknown => 
8/28/2023 2:32:19 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => And then I think the main discussion we should have is. If we want to make group of amongst the same project or among the same title.
8/28/2023 2:32:21 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, yeah. Professor, Assistant or yeah.
8/28/2023 2:32:34 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Couple of prophets and assistant or yeah. That's more a conceptual question than a practical question.
8/28/2023 2:32:41 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Well, the third option is just completely mix everyone up, which some people say is better sort of for a group environment, so that you're not stuck only with the people who are working on your project, right? So if you share an office with someone who's in a completely different project, you find out about that project, but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis.
8/28/2023 2:32:56 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => But still I find it quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same way because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe, I don't know if it's. For other people who are not working.
8/28/2023 2:32:56 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => On the same project? Yeah, but we will have this reading room. Yeah, that's true. Which can be.
8/28/2023 2:32:57 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Yeah. Will it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings that can reserve it for meetings?
8/28/2023 2:32:57 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => I think it's not a question of reserving it because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting, but if it's empty, then sure, you can use it for a meeting. There's nothing wrong with that, but I think if someone's already reading in there, it's not fair to go and kick them out just because.
8/28/2023 2:33:03 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => You want to have a meeting because the problem is if you have to go. Across the building and. It adds some overhead every time you want to have some short. Meeting, meeting and discuss some issues. Maybe we shouldn't call it.
8/28/2023 2:33:14 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => But if you're having a short meeting, you don't really. Make an appointment for it. You just kind of. Go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever. Because there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:33:14 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not because.
8/28/2023 2:33:25 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah.
8/28/2023 2:33:25 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Marianne and I interacted with student and we have reception hours and stuff like that. So it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and.
8/28/2023 2:33:25 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => So, and the other Marianne does too.
8/28/2023 2:33:31 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Yeah. So maybe 3. Nice to have to share an office with somebody like us. Having a lot of social life and.
8/28/2023 2:33:40 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Either share offices with each other, yeah, which doesn't really solve the problem, because chances are you're not going to have office hours at the exact same time, so you're still going to have. Like unless you get individual offices. I don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that. Because even if each of you share with the professor, then it's the same thing for the professor, yeah?
8/28/2023 2:33:42 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Yeah.
8/28/2023 2:33:54 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => But it is something to keep in mind. You end up sharing an office with someone where your schedule is completely don't overlap, and then you can schedule office hours when the other person isn't there. Some people come in around 11 and some people come in around 8:00.
8/28/2023 2:33:54 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => But that's something we can't reasonably assume like that, no make plans with that because.
8/28/2023 2:34:08 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => No, but you sort of see people's patterns, I mean. Even if it's not always like that, I mean if it's like that, you know, 80% of the time then. But you're right, we can't make assumptions too much.
8/28/2023 2:34:08 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => So people would like to see the office organised by by, by rank, like professors and students and.
8/28/2023 2:34:09 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => I don't know.
8/28/2023 2:34:24 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => I think. Well, it's up to us how we do it. I can see benefits of both. Yeah, should lose, but.
8/28/2023 2:34:44 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => One point I can say by experience, it's really hard to share an office with three people because it makes much more noise than only being two in an office. Yeah, plus the computers. The computers. So. So we might be it might be a good idea to 1st exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room. And not to be necessary. A room with three people a working.
8/28/2023 2:34:44 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => Room. But if there are people coming in, I mean we have these people working for two months who comes in the summer time or something, I think we should reserve a little bit space for them to so.
8/28/2023 2:34:53 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, that's a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, it's quite then everyone has an office, right, because maximum 18. So take away three spaces and you're down to your 15 and you're right. If we do have a staggered or whoever who comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room, but that kind of defeats the purpose.
8/28/2023 2:35:04 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So the other solution is to say, OK, we use the three person room but only with two person each time. And leave a spare space. For that change, there's some now, yeah. But avoiding. Having three person full time in the same room, Yeah, could be a good idea.
8/28/2023 2:35:14 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => I think that's or again, find people who don't work the same hours, yeah. It doesn't completely solve the problem, but.
8/28/2023 2:35:14 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So for the reading room we will have a two person room.
8/28/2023 2:35:15 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, yeah, I.
8/28/2023 2:35:15 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Think everybody agrees.
8/28/2023 2:35:15 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => On that one person will be too small.
8/28/2023 2:35:15 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Anyways, how about how about this room?
8/28/2023 2:35:15 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => The one the bottom.
8/28/2023 2:35:18 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Yeah, at the bottom, in the middle. Mountains. Yeah. It has three windows, so I think it's two.
8/28/2023 2:35:29 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Two. Well, which there's three two person rooms.
8/28/2023 2:35:29 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => The the middle one.
8/28/2023 2:35:29 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => That has two windows. Yeah, it's. Which is fine. It's still.
8/28/2023 2:35:29 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => A big room, big black stripe is the windows. Ohh that's seen one between the big.
8/28/2023 2:35:29 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => OK, yeah, sorry, I should have explained that.
8/28/2023 2:35:30 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => But what about the the other one which has only one windows, but in the courtyard it may be more quiet?
8/28/2023 2:35:34 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, but then you don't get a lot of light. For reading.
8/28/2023 2:35:34 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => We have electricity so.
8/28/2023 2:35:36 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => I hope really.
8/28/2023 2:35:52 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Needs a question. I mean it. It's quite noisy outside with the streets and.
8/28/2023 2:35:52 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => That's on the 6th floor. I don't know.
8/28/2023 2:35:52 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Yeah, we are on.
8/28/2023 2:35:52 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => The 6th floor. I know. I like the idea of looking. Out. Over. Yeah, me too. Lots of.
8/28/2023 2:35:52 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => Space Reading. Reading.
8/28/2023 2:35:53 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So it's a relaxing.
8/28/2023 2:35:53 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Room. Well, I mean, that's the whole point, right? It's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while, whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space.
8/28/2023 2:35:53 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => You can look outside of the window if you have a quick meeting there.
8/28/2023 2:35:55 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So what about one of the room in the corner? So you have 3 windows? It's even better.
8/28/2023 2:35:55 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, we could do.
8/28/2023 2:35:56 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => That I don't but you have less wall to put shelves and.
8/28/2023 2:35:59 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah.
8/28/2023 2:36:04 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => If you intend the reading room being more the library are.
8/28/2023 2:36:21 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => We have some shelves like cabinet type shelves for the reading room, but it's not really intended to be a library. I mean, we have. And at library. Boats. The other idea is to take because right now we all have bookshelves. So when idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people, put them all into that room. So it becomes sort of. Your library, but not like a library system library. Just go and borrow your colleagues books.
8/28/2023 2:36:28 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So are we all agree about this too? Person rooms. Which one I don't know or not.
8/28/2023 2:36:29 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Corner, I think the middle one.
8/28/2023 2:36:29 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => In the middle one. Yeah, OK.
8/28/2023 2:36:34 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, that's also sort of central to the layout. So everyone sort of has more or less the same distance to. It's not that it makes that much of a difference, but. Why not?
8/28/2023 2:36:36 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So we can exclude this one to make. An office, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:36:42 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => So what I can do is.
8/28/2023 2:36:42 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Well, maybe right on the board, I didn't know.
8/28/2023 2:36:42 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Actually, it's a good idea. Just put it up.
8/28/2023 2:36:45 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So we have the map and.
8/28/2023 2:36:55 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => So. This really isn't too scale, but ohh well. Umm. That's really not to scale.
8/28/2023 2:36:56 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => All right, good enough.
8/28/2023 2:37:10 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => So we've got. An office there. There's. 213, yeah. Is that, Yeah. Ohh. So I guess this is. With that, and this becomes the reading room, right?
8/28/2023 2:37:22 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => OK. Is that a mountain? Yes. OK, so. And then you know. Yeah. So we decide also the administration stuff.
8/28/2023 2:37:27 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => And sure.
8/28/2023 2:37:41 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => So we exclude the the thing we are quite sure. Yeah. And then we discussed there, I was thinking of maybe we should assign Gisella into this three person office. Because we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes. And we could have Gisella and the 250% people sharing the three.
8/28/2023 2:37:41 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => Person.
8/28/2023 2:37:41 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Room personal That's really noisy to be in the same office. Well, this is the administration.
8/28/2023 2:37:41 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => But if Giselle works 50% and they work 50.
8/28/2023 2:37:47 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Percent that just simply you expect people to come when Gisella is not working. That's true. And that's not really fair if you. Yeah, well so we can put these two people room. Which is near the mailbox.
8/28/2023 2:37:48 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => You know, we, yeah, we could.
8/28/2023 2:37:59 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => I don't know.
8/28/2023 2:37:59 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => We could. I mean, I don't know how noisy she.
8/28/2023 2:37:59 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Is it? It's just it's you always have the phone ringing, even if they have, even when.
8/28/2023 2:37:59 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => She doesn't have her own printer.
8/28/2023 2:38:00 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => Yes, yes, she.
8/28/2023 2:38:00 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Does, yeah, but that's a good point from Nikos to say that she needs to be near the mailbox and the printer and.
8/28/2023 2:38:03 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Well, if you put her in the photography in this room here. It's relatively close.
8/28/2023 2:38:04 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Except the door is not really.
8/28/2023 2:38:04 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Convenient for her, Convenient.
8/28/2023 2:38:07 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => True.
8/28/2023 2:38:18 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Yeah, but I think if if the main. How can I put that then? If the main reason to put. To to choose to the last place is the proximity of the mailbox. It should be a two people room and not a three people room.
8/28/2023 2:38:28 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => OK. That's fine with me.
8/28/2023 2:38:28 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Otherwise we have the one people room and.
8/28/2023 2:38:28 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => I don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail, she actually brings it to your office. Yeah, it's it's more the administration that uses our.
8/28/2023 2:38:29 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Mailboxes of the photography, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:38:29 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => And the place where we all pass, kind of, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:38:35 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => That's true.
8/28/2023 2:38:40 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => It's just because if we put the photography near the mailbox and it seems to be the only place where there is room for that.
8/28/2023 2:38:40 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah, unless you put it into an office, which is just an annoying, I think. Yeah, because even if you put it into Gisella's office, it's gonna.
8/28/2023 2:38:40 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Be and it's too big and.
8/28/2023 2:38:46 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah.
8/28/2023 2:38:59 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Maybe we should write this down. Do we agree that the that the photocopier and the network printer goes next to the mailboxes? Yeah, that's OK.
8/28/2023 2:38:59 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => And then we can for them and put these align this corner room. If you agree, I don't know, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:39:01 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => But at the beginning we said that we were going to give her one of the one person rooms.
8/28/2023 2:39:02 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => But the way this option of putting the light near the photography.
8/28/2023 2:39:09 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah.
8/28/2023 2:39:10 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => I mean, she's sharing an office right now and has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or?
8/28/2023 2:39:17 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => I mean, she's, she's. Sharing an office, I mean, we put some strangers in there, in the office because there is a spare room.
8/28/2023 2:39:20 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => And really in a position to complain.
8/28/2023 2:39:39 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => I mean that's quite important to keep a spare room in Gisella's office if we need more staff, but. I wouldn't work into that office.
8/28/2023 2:39:40 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => OK. I think it's just a question of work conditions like if you're stagger and you're only coming in for two months, then you can put up with it, but if you're. There you know for example the.
8/28/2023 2:39:40 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Full year, for example. And there is no room in the cupboards for any people except Gisella, because she got lots of paper archives and files and stuff like that. So it's really she needs, she needs space, space.
8/28/2023 2:39:45 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => OK. But we can reserve, so if you reserve two people room we can. Put the trainees.
8/28/2023 2:39:45 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Hmm, yeah. And then they need to go in the same room.
8/28/2023 2:39:45 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Yeah. OK. So Giselle at the Southwest office, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:39:57 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => Yeah, the corner.
8/28/2023 2:39:57 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Are you sure it's Southwest? I don't know if this if.
8/28/2023 2:40:02 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => This map is, well, SW if that's N OK. The map is southwest for us. No, no. Well, I'm assuming that's what you meant, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's SE anyways.
8/28/2023 2:40:02 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Southeast, yeah, alright. Yeah, that's.
8/28/2023 2:40:03 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Southeast, yeah. Anyways, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:40:03 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => This office, right?
8/28/2023 2:40:03 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Yeah, that's office, yeah.
8/28/2023 2:40:03 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => You know, because with mountain mountains and Old Town, it's not no sorry until.
8/28/2023 2:40:10 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => But no I. I'm very bad at orienting. Where's north in Geneva? I always get it wrong, but I just assumed Nicos was.
8/28/2023 2:40:10 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Talking with orientation here.
8/28/2023 2:40:13 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Because sunrise and sunshine is quite sunshine, sunrise and sunset, it's quite, it's true, a good. So wait, something.
8/28/2023 2:40:18 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Today we face the Old Town. We face the Old Town now. And we're facing NE North Northeast.
8/28/2023 2:40:18 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Sunrise.
8/28/2023 2:40:21 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => OK, so.
8/28/2023 2:40:24 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => This is northeast. We we have sun in the morning only.
8/28/2023 2:40:30 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Yeah.
8/28/2023 2:40:37 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => When do we have? So it just mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast is the most sunny. One. This one. Let's say that these. It's the one you have now. You both. It's the oven.
8/28/2023 2:40:44 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => Well, there's a cut.
8/28/2023 2:40:44 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => Three women. It's yeah, it's really You get lots of sun during summer.
8/28/2023 2:40:44 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Yeah, yeah. By the way, is it a 6th floor building or is there?
8/28/2023 2:40:44 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => More. Yeah, we're the top floor.
8/28/2023 2:40:49 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => OK. So it's warm. Yeah.
8/28/2023 2:40:54 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now. We're just getting more space this way because we couldn't move in the other building because it was occupied by the other departments.
8/28/2023 2:40:57 PM: Speaker Guest-4 => OK, good. So.
8/28/2023 2:41:01 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => So how many rooms? And how many place do we have?
8/28/2023 2:41:10 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => So we have reserved now to 100. Change it on here as well. So that's Gisella.
8/28/2023 2:41:10 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Yeah, plus one space place, but really the last place to be used.
8/28/2023 2:41:21 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Plus fax. Yeah. Hmm. And then this is. The Reading room, OK. Um. So that leaves us with.
8/28/2023 2:41:21 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => What you're getting 234.
8/28/2023 2:41:21 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => 614 places which is.
8/28/2023 2:41:25 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => 1414 people.
8/28/2023 2:41:26 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => For 14 years, 10 people. No. For 14, because Giselle is already. Yeah. Yeah. Got a room. Yeah. Yeah.
8/28/2023 2:41:29 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => OK.
8/28/2023 2:41:41 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Bless you. Excuse me, yes. OK, umm. So, so I'm going to take Gisella off of. That list. As well. I'll put her in Gray, I guess.
8/28/2023 2:41:47 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Can we group people by their name?
8/28/2023 2:41:51 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => So it's gonna be Mariano's office. It's it's any fun. Is there anybody who's not happy with the current situation? So we could try to just. Keep the same arrangement, just on the new.
8/28/2023 2:41:58 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Building. Yeah, that's good. That's boring. That's boring. That can be a good idea. But do do we? Can we? Can we? Because there is no. No, we can't because we can't.
8/28/2023 2:41:58 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => We have one extra one person office and.
8/28/2023 2:41:58 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => And two three.
8/28/2023 2:42:03 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => 2-3 personal offices, yeah. Plus we have the two people who. Aren't there now? Yeah. No, I have to put some more. You can keep some of the people together that are.
8/28/2023 2:42:04 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => Together now but.
8/28/2023 2:42:05 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Not everyone, definitely.
8/28/2023 2:42:25 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => OK. So let's start then. Top to bottom, Maggie.
8/28/2023 2:42:25 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => Well, why don't we take a break and go off and think about it? Yeah. And then I think we, once we have more concrete ideas, Yeah, OK, we can come back and finish it. Because if we just sit here and discuss, yeah, it's going to take a long time. We're gonna start arguing and get cranky and.
8/28/2023 2:42:31 PM: Speaker Guest-2 => OK. So let's have a break. Save your file. You have XP? Yep. That's nice.
8/28/2023 2:42:31 PM: Speaker Unknown => Hmm.
8/28/2023 2:42:33 PM: Speaker Guest-1 => OK.
8/28/2023 2:42:39 PM: Speaker Guest-3 => So how long it's gonna be?
8/28/2023 2:42:39 PM: Speaker Unknown => Hmm.
8/28/2023 2:42:39 PM: Session stopped event
9/1/2023 11:35:52 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:05.7100000  => OK. So as you guys know, Isco is too small. Well, the building is too small for our group. So we're moving to a new building. It's going to be the building across the street and we're actually moving in three weeks. But the problem is that the administration wants to know who's going to be in what office in the new building and where we'll get, we're going to put things like. The printer, the fax machine, all the big equipment and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment. And they want to know where we're going to do all of this by November 2nd. So that means basically next Tuesday, and since we don't really have any other time, we have to make. These decisions today. What we're getting is 9 rooms for a maximum of 18 people, which is OK because there's only fifteen of us and all the rooms have windows, luckily, so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't. There's two views, either of the Old Town or the mountains, and the rooms have various sizes. There's 2-3 people rooms 5 two person rooms which are on the corners of the building, so you actually get. Windows on two walls. And two, one person rooms. That's pretty much what the building looks like. And then you have the number of people per room. The courtyard. Because we're on the 6th floor, you can't actually go out to it, but just means that the windows look out onto open space. And you can see the bathrooms, the elevators are sort of further down the hall. The purple bar at the bottom sort of on the right is the mailboxes. All of the windows open. You can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building. And the equipment that we have to put somewhere are, like I said, the photocopier, which is really big, the fax machine, which is not so big, and the printer, which is relatively big. Each office has a white board, a bulletin board and a coat rack, no cupboards like we have in the current offices. And each person gets their own chair, their own corner desk. So like the the ones that we have now, a small filing cabinet with three drawers. And by small, I mean they're about that tall. And one sort of hanging shelf, so we don't get the bookcases like we have now, but just one shelf that's attached to the wall. And the people that we have to place. You can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on. And I guess the question, the first question is how we want to organize people, whether we want to do it by rank or by project or? I don't know, put all the PhD students together, all the professors together and that sort of thing. So the idea is that we come up with a plan, there's another group who's gonna be working on the same plan later this week, and then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the 2nd. So I have to come up with a plan, possibly if we have time and presentation, a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best. OK. So anyone have any ideas or? I guess.
9/1/2023 11:38:45 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:05.7100000  => OK. So as you guys know, Isco is too small. Well, the building is too small for our group. So we're moving to a new building.

9/1/2023 11:38:54 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:09.6100000  => And do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the whole? In terms of security staff, if we can, I mean my idea is to put the photocopy on the facts. In the hole, yeah.
9/1/2023 11:39:00 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:02.3800000  => I think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building. So as long as the things are physically attached to the wall so they can't be removed, then it should be OK to leave them in the hall. It's just a question of whether you're printing the sensitive documents or whatever.
9/1/2023 11:39:04 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:07.2900000  => So we only get one printer for 15 people.
9/1/2023 11:39:36 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:02.8800000  => Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer, which Isella has one, maybe, Yeah, I can't remember who else. Yeah, But no one else gets their own printer. In terms of equipment. It's sort of the same thing as we have now. So what I'd propose is that we sort of discussed various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Ohh. And on the map the little half circular well quarter circles are doors, which I'm assuming you figured out, but just in case. And there's just the one room that actually has 2 doors going into it, the the three person room on the right.
9/1/2023 11:39:36 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:04.9900000  => Yeah, and do we need a room like a reading?
9/1/2023 11:39:55 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:00.6400000  => Room, Yes, Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room. That's a good idea, so we should leave a space for that. And we can't because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and there's only fifteen of us. And I don't know if you noticed, but two of us are only here half the time, so Martin and David are half the time at the PFL and half the time in Geneva, so. Sort of. Keep that in mind, I guess. When. You're doing the actual planning.
9/1/2023 11:39:58 AM: Speakers Unknown 00:00:04.4900000  => Hmm.
9/1/2023 11:39:58 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:01.2400000  => The first split we can do is between administration and research.
9/1/2023 11:39:59 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:01.9200000  => Yeah, I mean.
9/1/2023 11:40:03 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:00.3500000  => It's completely different work so. We can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then.
9/1/2023 11:40:07 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:05.4500000  => Yeah. But Giselle is really the only.
9/1/2023 11:40:20 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:04.4700000  => Administrators deal with that. Yeah. Particular situation, yeah. And then see. With the other because they were thinking at Gisela is quite, I mean Gillette Giselle's work is quite noisy because it's secretary. So you get yeah lots of phone call. And stuff like that. And she's. Always moving around so you won't share an office with gisella unless you have 50% and not the 50% is working, yeah, which is another condition.
9/1/2023 11:40:29 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:09.5800000  => Which I don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them.
9/1/2023 11:40:31 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:03.4300000  => So, I don't know, maybe we can decide that Jesus likes having one of the one person room. Yeah, I I would suggest that too. Yeah, maybe convenient.
9/1/2023 11:40:41 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:05.5500000  => Yeah, either that or maybe put her in a two person room. With the equipment? Or like with the the photocopier? Or maybe not the photocopier but the printer.
9/1/2023 11:40:41 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:04.3100000  => Yeah. But at least the thing we know is that Jessica is going to be alone. Yeah. Yeah. Or with equipment.
9/1/2023 11:40:46 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:09.4500000  => But not with 100% staff and staff worker.
9/1/2023 11:40:51 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:04.0700000  => OK, so it's a one person room, but we don't know how how big they are or it's hard to tell. I mean, Gisella has this funny, uh, typing.
9/1/2023 11:40:51 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:04.8900000  => Yeah, the rooms aren't tiny if you.
9/1/2023 11:40:53 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:03.5700000  => Look at the facts. Yeah, so probably she should Get the facts right.
9/1/2023 11:41:06 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:13.7200000  => Yeah, yeah, that makes sense to put the facts in there. So.
9/1/2023 11:41:14 AM: Speakers Unknown 00:00:03.2200000  => 
9/1/2023 11:41:17 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:03.6800000  => And then I think the main discussion we should have is. If we want to make group of amongst the same project or among the same title.
9/1/2023 11:41:18 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:03.0900000  => Yeah, yeah. Professor, Assistant or yeah.
9/1/2023 11:41:33 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:18.9700000  => Couple of prophets and assistant or yeah. That's more a conceptual question than a practical question.
9/1/2023 11:41:40 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:12.3500000  => Well, the third option is just completely mix everyone up, which some people say is better sort of for a group environment, so that you're not stuck only with the people who are working on your project, right? So if you share an office with someone who's in a completely different project, you find out about that project, but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis.
9/1/2023 11:41:56 AM: Speakers Guest-4 00:00:04.5300000  => But still I find it quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same way because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe, I don't know if it's. For other people who are not working.
9/1/2023 11:41:56 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:05.7500000  => On the same project? Yeah, but we will have this reading room. Yeah, that's true. Which can be.
9/1/2023 11:41:56 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:15.2700000  => Yeah. Will it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings that can reserve it for meetings?
9/1/2023 11:41:56 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:03.1600000  => I think it's not a question of reserving it because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting, but if it's empty, then sure, you can use it for a meeting. There's nothing wrong with that, but I think if someone's already reading in there, it's not fair to go and kick them out just because.
9/1/2023 11:42:02 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:02.4400000  => You want to have a meeting because the problem is if you have to go. Across the building and. It adds some overhead every time you want to have some short. Meeting, meeting and discuss some issues. Maybe we shouldn't call it.
9/1/2023 11:42:13 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:06.0100000  => But if you're having a short meeting, you don't really. Make an appointment for it. You just kind of. Go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever. Because there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal, yeah.
9/1/2023 11:42:13 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:00.7200000  => The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not because.
9/1/2023 11:42:24 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:09.8900000  => Yeah.
9/1/2023 11:42:24 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:02.1600000  => Marianne and I interacted with student and we have reception hours and stuff like that. So it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and.
9/1/2023 11:42:24 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:05.2600000  => So, and the other Marianne does too.
9/1/2023 11:42:30 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:11.4100000  => Yeah. So maybe 3. Nice to have to share an office with somebody like us. Having a lot of social life and.
9/1/2023 11:42:40 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:00.2600000  => Either share offices with each other, yeah, which doesn't really solve the problem, because chances are you're not going to have office hours at the exact same time, so you're still going to have. Like unless you get individual offices. I don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that. Because even if each of you share with the professor, then it's the same thing for the professor, yeah?
9/1/2023 11:42:41 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:01.5700000  => Yeah.
9/1/2023 11:42:54 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:07.2800000  => But it is something to keep in mind. You end up sharing an office with someone where your schedule is completely don't overlap, and then you can schedule office hours when the other person isn't there. Some people come in around 11 and some people come in around 8:00.
9/1/2023 11:42:54 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:02.7000000  => But that's something we can't reasonably assume like that, no make plans with that because.
9/1/2023 11:43:07 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:08.0500000  => No, but you sort of see people's patterns, I mean. Even if it's not always like that, I mean if it's like that, you know, 80% of the time then. But you're right, we can't make assumptions too much.
9/1/2023 11:43:07 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:01.0800000  => So people would like to see the office organised by by, by rank, like professors and students and.
9/1/2023 11:43:08 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:00.4900000  => I don't know.
9/1/2023 11:43:23 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:14.6200000  => I think. Well, it's up to us how we do it. I can see benefits of both. Yeah, should lose, but.
9/1/2023 11:43:43 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:15  => One point I can say by experience, it's really hard to share an office with three people because it makes much more noise than only being two in an office. Yeah, plus the computers. The computers. So. So we might be it might be a good idea to 1st exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room. And not to be necessary. A room with three people a working.
9/1/2023 11:43:43 AM: Speakers Guest-4 00:00:10.4300000  => Room. But if there are people coming in, I mean we have these people working for two months who comes in the summer time or something, I think we should reserve a little bit space for them to so.
9/1/2023 11:43:53 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:05.5900000  => Yeah, that's a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, it's quite then everyone has an office, right, because maximum 18. So take away three spaces and you're down to your 15 and you're right. If we do have a staggered or whoever who comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room, but that kind of defeats the purpose.
9/1/2023 11:44:03 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:05.5300000  => So the other solution is to say, OK, we use the three person room but only with two person each time. And leave a spare space. For that change, there's some now, yeah. But avoiding. Having three person full time in the same room, Yeah, could be a good idea.
9/1/2023 11:44:14 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:03.6100000  => I think that's or again, find people who don't work the same hours, yeah. It doesn't completely solve the problem, but.
9/1/2023 11:44:14 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:00.7300000  => So for the reading room we will have a two person room.
9/1/2023 11:44:14 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:01.4500000  => Yeah, yeah, I.
9/1/2023 11:44:14 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:01.5000000  => Think everybody agrees.
9/1/2023 11:44:14 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:02.5400000  => On that one person will be too small.
9/1/2023 11:44:14 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:01.5000000  => Anyways, how about how about this room?
9/1/2023 11:44:14 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:01.6700000  => The one the bottom.
9/1/2023 11:44:17 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:03.6500000  => Yeah, at the bottom, in the middle. Mountains. Yeah. It has three windows, so I think it's two.
9/1/2023 11:44:28 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:01.4100000  => Two. Well, which there's three two person rooms.
9/1/2023 11:44:28 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:04.4600000  => The the middle one.
9/1/2023 11:44:28 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:06.1000000  => That has two windows. Yeah, it's. Which is fine. It's still.
9/1/2023 11:44:28 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:02.9100000  => A big room, big black stripe is the windows. Ohh that's seen one between the big.
9/1/2023 11:44:28 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:06.0500000  => OK, yeah, sorry, I should have explained that.
9/1/2023 11:44:29 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:01.7600000  => But what about the the other one which has only one windows, but in the courtyard it may be more quiet?
9/1/2023 11:44:33 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:01.6200000  => Yeah, but then you don't get a lot of light. For reading.
9/1/2023 11:44:33 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:02.2400000  => We have electricity so.
9/1/2023 11:44:36 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:04.2500000  => I hope really.
9/1/2023 11:44:51 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:02.0300000  => Needs a question. I mean it. It's quite noisy outside with the streets and.
9/1/2023 11:44:51 AM: Speakers Guest-4 00:00:01.5600000  => That's on the 6th floor. I don't know.
9/1/2023 11:44:52 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:02  => Yeah, we are on.
9/1/2023 11:44:52 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:01.4600000  => The 6th floor. I know. I like the idea of looking. Out. Over. Yeah, me too. Lots of.
9/1/2023 11:44:52 AM: Speakers Guest-4 00:00:01.5600000  => Space Reading. Reading.
9/1/2023 11:44:52 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:09.6800000  => So it's a relaxing.
9/1/2023 11:44:52 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:03.6600000  => Room. Well, I mean, that's the whole point, right? It's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while, whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space.
9/1/2023 11:44:52 AM: Speakers Guest-3 00:00:05.6800000  => You can look outside of the window if you have a quick meeting there.
9/1/2023 11:44:54 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:00.6900000  => So what about one of the room in the corner? So you have 3 windows? It's even better.
9/1/2023 11:44:54 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:03.4800000  => Yeah, we could do.
9/1/2023 11:44:55 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:00.6200000  => That I don't but you have less wall to put shelves and.
9/1/2023 11:44:57 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:03.3200000  => Yeah.
9/1/2023 11:45:03 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:07.9700000  => If you intend the reading room being more the library are.
9/1/2023 11:45:20 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:01.9500000  => We have some shelves like cabinet type shelves for the reading room, but it's not really intended to be a library. I mean, we have. And at library. Boats. The other idea is to take because right now we all have bookshelves. So when idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people, put them all into that room. So it becomes sort of. Your library, but not like a library system library. Just go and borrow your colleagues books.
9/1/2023 11:45:28 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:02.4000000  => So are we all agree about this too? Person rooms. Which one I don't know or not.
9/1/2023 11:45:28 AM: Speakers Guest-1 00:00:01.4500000  => Corner, I think the middle one.
9/1/2023 11:45:28 AM: Speakers Guest-2 00:00:06.1700000  => In the middle one. Yeah, OK.
